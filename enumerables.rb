# given an array of spicy foods, **return an array of strings**
# with the names of each spicy food
def get_names(spicy_foods)
  # spicy_foods.map{ |food| food.name} will not work, because this returns an array of hashes! How do we access hashes Trey? With BRACKET NOTATION! So instead let's use the following: 
  spicy_foods.map{ |food| food[:name]}
  # binding.pry
  # your code here
end

# given an array of spicy foods, **return an array of hashes** 
# where the heat level of the food is greater than 5
def spiciest_foods(spicy_foods)
  # binding.pry
  spicy_foods.filter{ |food|  food[:heat_level] > 5 }
  # your code here
end

# given an array of spicy foods, **output to the terminal**
# each spicy food in the following format: 
# Buffalo Wings (American) | Heat Level: ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶
# HINT: you can use * with a string to produce the correct number of ðŸŒ¶ emoji. 
# "hello" * 3 == "hellohellohello"

# I'm struggling to access the values correctly here. I need to figure out how to grab EACH of the hash keys and then use string interpolation(?). .map works to grab the key values but it doesnt work with .each... Maybe I need more methods here? Hmmm. Let's work from left to right and grab a little at a time. 

# Doesn't work:
# spicy_foods.map { |food| print food[:name]} returns: [nil, nil, nil]
# spicy_foods.map { |food| puts food[:name]} returns: [nil, nil, nil]

# ???? Why does this spicy_foods.each { |food| food[:name]} grab EACH hash instead of each value of each hash? Is it because only .map/.filter return an array?... Hmm. I thought puts would've printed each hash value for names.. I can look at my old lab but I really want to understand HOW to access this and WHY my ways currently are not working. Before just looking at the right answer and saying oh.. Okay.
